# decision-engine
local-first Windows desktop finance simulator: Decision Engine (MVP) = Cashflow timeline + Debt payoff (avalanche/snowball/custom extra) + “buffer breach” warnings + scenario saving to SQLite + side-by-side scenario compare.  It’s a Tauri (Windows app) + React + TypeScript + SQLite project. No server. No accounts. Your data stays local.
